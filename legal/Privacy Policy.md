**Last updated:** January 30, 2025

**Contact:** iv@nosota.com

Your privacy is important to us. miniPDFSign is designed to operate fully offline and does not collect any personal data.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

miniPDFSign does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Specifically, we do not collect:

- Personal identifiers (name, email address, phone number)
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Location data
- Documents you open or edit
- Images of signatures, stamps, or other content you add
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Crash reports or diagnostics

## 2. Local Processing Only

All documents, images, and data are processed and stored **locally on your device**. Nothing is uploaded to external servers or cloud services.

Your files remain entirely under your control.

## 3. No Tracking or Advertising

miniPDFSign does not use:

- Advertising frameworks or ad networks
- Analytics SDKs (such as Google Analytics or Firebase Analytics)
- Tracking pixels or similar technologies
- Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework (because we do not track users)

We do not participate in any cross-app or cross-site tracking.

## 4. Third-Party Services

miniPDFSign does not integrate with third-party services that collect user data. Because we do not collect any data, there is nothing to share with third parties.

## 5. Data Stored on Your Device

miniPDFSign stores the following data locally on your device:

- **Signature and stamp images** you add to your library
- **Recently opened files** list (file names and paths only)
- **App preferences** (language, display settings)

This data is stored in the app's private storage area and is not accessible to other apps. You can delete this data at any time by uninstalling the app.

## 6. Age Requirement

miniPDFSign is intended for users aged **12 and older**. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 12. If you are under 12, please do not use this app.

## 7. Your Rights

Even though we do not collect personal data, you have the right to:

- **Access**: Request confirmation that we do not hold your data
- **Deletion**: Uninstall the app to remove all locally stored data
- **Portability**: Export your signature images from the app at any time

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), these rights are guaranteed under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For users in California, similar rights are provided under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

## 8. Data Security

Since all data remains on your device and is never transmitted, the security of your data depends on your device's security settings (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID, encryption).

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of miniPDFSign after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
